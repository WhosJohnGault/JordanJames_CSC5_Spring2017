//Program Execution Begins Here

//reaction and decision variables for combat and exploration
//enemy hp stat for combat use
//a type of limit to the loop which allows for input before repetiton
//max hp is a value that is used to differentiate between max hp and enemy hp
//enter is used to progress dialogue

//this causes the user to prompt the game/program to begin
//prologue/ character introduction sequence
    //mandatory intro/thank you sequence
    


  //this will cause a user requested input to prompt
   //name input for your character, can handle spaces
    //this is what allows the user input name to handle spaces
    //input will act as the players name in dialogue and possible combat menus in future versions
    
    //this prompt causes the dialogue to continue
    
    //first combat encounter,has yet to be completely worked out, will be implemented in version   
    //variables used in this prototype called combat, react and enemy hp
    //basic enemy ai whos actions will be determined by their hp and a random seed
    
    //user decision causes different scenarios to take place      
    
    //brief ending statement        
    //return

    //bulk of void function for combat, including enemy reactions
    //a modular encounter, likely the only encounter
    //embeded do loops to keep combat dynamic 
    
    //setting a seed 

    //this seed will determine what action the enemy takes
    // landing a 1 will cause them to attack
    // 2 will cause them to dodge
    //3 will cause a short dialogue, but there is no escape

    //enemy hp has different reactions based on their hp value
// this program will continue until the enemy is defeated
